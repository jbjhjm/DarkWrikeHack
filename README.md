# Wrike Dark Theme Hack [Chrome Extension]

This is a tiny chrome extension injecting custom style into [Wrike Workspace](http://wrike.com) to hack in a dark theme.

As I'm using the free plan, pro features will look buggy most likely.

This project is experimental and may break at any time depending on wrike's compilation setup and release cycles.

## Installation

Currently there are no packed releases so this is what to do:

Download the source files into a folder of your choice. Open chrome and navigate to chrome://extensions.

On the top bar, click "enable developer features", then on "load unpacked extension".

In the dialog, navigate to the folder containing source files and click ok. 

Open / Reload wrike.
