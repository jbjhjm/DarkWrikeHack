# Wrike Dark Theme Hack [Chrome Extension]

This is a tiny chrome extension injecting custom style into [Wrike Workspace](http://wrike.com) to hack in a dark theme.

As I'm using the free plan, pro features will stay white or might be buggy.

This theme is experimental and may break at any time depending on Wrike's compilation setup and release cycles.
The theme has been tested with Wrike version 1.24.0 (1941500).

## Installation

### Using packed extension

Enabling a packed extension is only possible if it is from Chrome Web Store.
As I'm not releasing it in CWS, currently the only solution is to use the unpacked extension and the developer mode.

### Using Developer Mode

Currently there are no packed releases so this is what to do:

Download the source files into a folder of your choice. Open chrome and navigate to chrome://extensions.

On the top bar, click "developer mode" on the right, then on the button "load unpacked extension".

In the dialog, navigate to the folder containing source files and click ok. 

Open / Reload wrike.
